Tradui was built by Intridea for Crisis Commons as part of Crisis Camp DC.  
Tradui, Creole for "translate", is an application for translating from 
Creole to English and English to Creole. The data for this application 
was extracted with permission from the HaitiSurf Creole to English

This app is primarily intended for use by on-the-ground aid workers 
during the Haiti crisis, but is made freely available for anyone to use.
