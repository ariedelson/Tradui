  		Tradui was built by <span id='intridea'>Intridea</span> for <span id='crisiscommons'>Crisis Commons</span> as part of Crisis Camp DC.  Tradui, Creole for "translate", is an application for translating from Creole to English and English to Creole. The data for this application was extracted with permission from the <span id='haitisurf'>HaitiSurf</span> Creole to English Dictionary. All of the translation capabilities of Tradui are available offline.
